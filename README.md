# CS-F213-OOPS-Project
An android app to help people mange their day to day tasks efficiently and was implemented for our project for the course CS F213-OOPS.

It is a group project of 4 in which we made an Android application which was used to keep track of home inventories available at our home and also keep track of our regular everyday tasks. This was done by setting reminders which would trigger email and SMS notifications on the email-id and mobile number which were used by the user for registration. In this way user got reminded of the tasks which were scheduled beforehand and helped the user in keeping track of the tasks.
